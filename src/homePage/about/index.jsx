          Mahrukh Ahmad, E-RYT-500 yoga teacher, was born in Lahore, Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving her Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Psychology with a focus on
          Positive Psychology, she moved to Dubai for five years, became a
          mother to a girl and a boy, and eventually settled in Northern
          Virginia in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          Positive Psychology sparked her interest in yoga, which soon became
          her passion. Following this passion, Mahrukh evolved into a
          compassionate and dedicated yoga teacher who leads with heart and
          guides her students on a soulful journey of self-discovery and growth.
